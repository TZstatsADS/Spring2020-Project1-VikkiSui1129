### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: What has changed over the years about music?
+ This project is conducted by Vikki Sui

+ Project summary: We are given by a dataset of around 380,000+ lyrics on kaggle and you can read more about it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics). In this project, we aimed to find out what has changed over the years including the length of the songs, the length of words the songs use, frequently used words, and emotions in different time periods.
